# An options file can contain any long options which are available in
# GnuPG. If the first non white space character of a line is a '#',
# this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also ignored.

# See the gpg man page for a list of options.


# If you have more than 1 secret key in your keyring, you may want to
# uncomment the following option and set your preferred keyid.

# the agent before it asks for a passphrase.
